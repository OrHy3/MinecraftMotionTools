# MinecraftMotionTools
MinecraftMotionTools is a collection of functions whose purpose is to ease prediction of the velocity and the position of entities simulated into Minecraft.
# How does it work?
Minecraft updates velocity in a different way from real-physics objects, plus it complicates everything just by being a video game and having to update the values in a finite unit of time (the tick).

Minecraft's Wiki got [some information](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity#Motion_of_entities) about how it works, but [here](https://hackmd.io/ySiQhr_SSUatNc6qAkbFcw) is the reasoning behind the velocity equations.

Another complication comes from what I, in the code, refer to as [acceleration drag](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity#cite_note-gravityBefore-4), which initially required forking the formulas for every different case (see [old sheet](https://hackmd.io/V9oMODQbT5mBA-o4OM76pA)), before I decided to generalize the formulas, introducing the coefficient `k`.

Acceleration drag works the following way:

$\text{position}\_{new}=\text{position}_{old}+\text{velocity}-k\cdot\text{acceleration}$

Finally, [here](https://hackmd.io/1t0ACyplTDKSgo-a1jA7nQ) is the formulas' sheet I wrote down. Take in mind that a fair amount of them make use of [Lambert's W function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function).

For the acceleration's formulas refer to [this sheet](https://hackmd.io/vvFAdzekSn6R7vc9Mw8lxg?view) instead.

NOTES:
- For fireballs and alike, use negative acceleration (see [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity#cite_ref-boom_5-0) why).
- Players, mobs and armor stands whose OnGround property is set to 1 have an horizontal drag force of 0.454.
- The maximum general velocity value is 10. Any greater value is reset to 0.
- Even though 10 is the maximum velocity that can be set, entities with 0 drag force can gain infinite velocity due to acceleration.
- Minecarts have a maximum horizontal velocity of 0.4. Any greater value is reset to that number.
- Boats' horizontal position gets updated using next tick's velocity instead of the current one.

|Name|Required arguments|Optional arguments|Brief description|
|-|-|-|-|
|v_from_t|v0, t|a, d, after|Retrieves velocity from an initial velocity and the time that has passed, in ticks.|
|p_from_t|v0, t|a, d, after, k|Retrieves relative position from an initial velocity and the time that has passed, in ticks.|
|max_height_tick_from_v0|v0|a, d, after, k|Retrieves the time in ticks the maximum relative height is reached.|

|v0_from_max_height|h|a, d, after, k|Retrieves a tuple of up to 2 solutions, each one belonging to the possible arcs with the specified height.|
|v0_from_v_t|v, t|a, d, after|Retrieves initial velocity from a pair of current velocity and time passed, in ticks.|

|t_from_v0_v|v0, v|a, d, after|Retrieves the time passed (in ticks) since velocity was v0 to become v.|
|t_from_v0_p|v0, p|a, d, after, k|Retrieves the time passed (in ticks) to reach the relative position specified.|
|v0_t_from_v_p|v, p|a, d, after, k|Retrieves a pair of initial velocity and time passed (in ticks) to reach the state of current velocity/position specified.|
### Acceleration related functions
These functions retrieve the acceleration from 2 state pairs of the wanted trajectory.<br>
Functions involving a velocity/position state pair are not guaranteed to retrieve all the solutions, though that should be a limit case.<br>
If drag is set to 0, all the functions will use safe algorithms, meaning iterative approximation algorithms won't be used.

Default parameters are set to Fireballs.<br>
