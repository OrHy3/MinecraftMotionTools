# MinecraftMotionTools
MinecraftMotionTools is a collection of functions whose purpose is to ease prediction of the velocity and the position of entities simulated into Minecraft.
# How does it work?
Minecraft updates velocity in a different way from real-physics objects, plus it complicates everything just by being a video game and having to update the values in a finite unit of time (the tick).

Minecraft's Wiki got [some information](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity#Motion_of_entities) about how it works, but [here](https://hackmd.io/ySiQhr_SSUatNc6qAkbFcw) is the reasoning behind the velocity equations.

Another complication comes from what I, in the code, refer to as [acceleration drag](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity#cite_note-gravityBefore-4), which initially required forking the formulas for every different case (see [old sheet](https://hackmd.io/V9oMODQbT5mBA-o4OM76pA)), before I decided to generalize the formulas, introducing the coefficient `k`.

Acceleration drag works the following way:

$\text{position}\_{new}=\text{position}_{old}+\text{velocity}-k\cdot\text{acceleration}$

Finally, [here](https://hackmd.io/1t0ACyplTDKSgo-a1jA7nQ) is the formulas' sheet I wrote down. Take in mind that a fair amount of them make use of [Lambert's W function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function).

NOTE: For fireballs and alike, use negative velocity and position, since "opposite acceleration" [would be negative for them](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity#cite_ref-boom_5-0).
